["Wrestling is a martial art that has a long and rich history dating back thousands of years. It has evolved over time with different styles and techniques being developed in various cultures. The basic holds and techniques of wrestling have changed very little over the centuries, but the specific rules have varied from culture to culture and over time.\n\nIn the United States, wrestling has had a significant impact on the development of martial arts. The four main styles of amateur wrestling that are practiced internationally today are freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, Judo, and Sambo. These styles have had a direct impact on the common styles of wrestling now in the United States, including collegiate, freestyle, Greco-Roman, professional, and no-holds barred or submission wrestling.\n\nThe history of wrestling in the United States can be traced back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where it was based mainly upon several European styles. However, due to the diversity of the country, undoubtedly had influences from Asia and Africa as well. In the United States during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most of the wrestling was done in the Greco-Roman style. A new style", "The four main styles of amateur wrestling that are practiced internationally today are freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, Judo, and Sambo. These styles differ from each other in terms of rules and techniques. Freestyle wrestling allows for the use of throws, holds, and pins, while Greco-Roman wrestling prohibits the use of throws and only allows for holds and pins. Judo, on the other hand, focuses on throws and joint locks, while Sambo is a relatively new martial art that was developed in Russia and incorporates judo techniques with native Russian wrestling.", "Some of the martial arts that have a large wrestling component and are practiced in the United States include judo, jujitsu, and mixed martial arts.", "The main finding of the research on aggression and gender in competitive sports is that the levels of aggression between male and female athletes are comparable, but differed with regards to the mechanisms that provoke and legitimize it. The studies also suggested that these responses are dependent upon the circumstances of provocation, and there is a decreased tendency for women to display aggression in unprovoked circumstances where aggressive behavior is considered less acceptable. Additionally, the concept of self-efficacy is recognized as an important factor in determining women's achievements in sports.", "The sporting context contributes to the amplification and legitimization of aggression in female athletes by providing a space for the amplification and legitimization of otherwise discouraged traits. The emphasis placed on points being rewarded when a technique is powerfully and accurately delivered can be considered a legitimate cause for exhibiting aggressive behavior. Additionally, the sporting arena can be perceived as a circumstance in which women can legitimately exhibit traits that are demanded by high-level competitive sport participation such as dominance, competitiveness, and aggression, without being confronted with masculine stereotypes. This can lead to the normalization and acceptance of aggressive behavior in female athletes, which can further amplify their propensity to display aggression.", "According to Susan Birrell, aggression in sports is legal and normative behavior, meaning it is an acceptable and expected feature of that particular social situation. However, aggression in other social contexts is not necessarily legal or normative, and therefore may not be considered acceptable or expected behavior. Additionally, aggression in sports is often encouraged and legitimized by coaches, female role models, and family members, which can amplify the propensity for female athletes to display aggression. In contrast, aggression in other social contexts may not have the same level of encouragement or legitimization, which can make it less likely for individuals to engage in aggressive behavior.", "The file path of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" is \"/app/data/processed_data/@M7 Papers/0 PDF Files/Copenhaver, Laura - Yongmudo Cross-Training.pdf\".", "The file size of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" is not provided in the context information.", "The creation date of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" is not provided in the context information.", "Based on the provided context information, the file name of the document located at /app/data/processed_data/@M7 Papers/0 PDF Files/Brown, Steve - Matwork Drills.pdf is not mentioned.

Grandmaster Ji began training yoo sool with Grandmaster Choi at the age of 13 in Daegu city, where they both were instrumental in publicizing hapkido throughout Korea following the Korean War. Grandmaster Ji also trained under a master known as \"Taoist Lee,\" from whom he learned tae-kyon kicking, jang-bong (six-foot staff), pe dan-bong (short stick), and meditation. Additionally, Grandmaster Ji studied meditation for five years under a female monk known to him as \"Grandma.\"\n\nLater, Grandmaster Ji left Daegu city and moved to Andong where he opened two yoo sool schools. He remained in Andong for only a short period of time before relocating to Seoul later in 1958. During this time, Grandmaster Ji's martial arts curriculum was finalized through a unique period of collaboration with a fellow colleague and former student Kim Moo Woong. Over the course of nearly eight months, Kim and Grandmaster Ji trained together and exchanged ideas about which", "Grandmaster Ji left Daegu city in 1958 and moved to Andong.", "Social legitimacy plays a crucial role in increasing a female athlete's sense of self-efficacy in Taekwondo. The concept of social legitimacy refers to the acceptance and approval of a particular behavior or activity by a particular subset of society, such as immediate friends, coaches, and family members. When women are able to feel confident and welcomed as active participants in Taekwondo, they are more likely to have a positive self-perception and increase their sense of self-efficacy. This can be achieved by redefining social legitimacy and constructing a sport in which women feel confident and supported. The growing popularity of Taekwondo and the increase in officially sanctioned arenas for competitive participation contribute to an overall increase in the opportunities for women to engage in successful, confidence-building experiences. Additionally, observing examples of success from role models can also influence a person's level of confidence and contribute to the socialization of acceptable avenues of pursuit.", "The quality and quantity of feedback can significantly affect a person's self-confidence. According to Cox, clear feedback regarding a person's performance can increase their self-confidence, while unclear and ambiguous feedback can lead to lower self-confidence. This is particularly true for women, who tend to have lower opinions of their abilities and respond with lower levels of self-confidence when feedback is unclear and ambiguous. Therefore, it is important to provide clear and constructive feedback to help individuals build their self-confidence.", "Some gender-specific and situational variables that adversely affect women's self-confidence in athletic scholarship include tasks perceived as masculine, ambiguous feedback or ability information, and emphasis on social comparison evaluation.", "The file name of the document provided in the context information is not explicitly stated.

When the air temperature is cooler, it is less able to hold moisture, which can lead to dryness in the air sacs. On the other hand, when the air temperature is warmer, it is able to hold more moisture, which can help to keep the alveoli safe from damage. In the range of air temperature and humidity that is comfortable to exercise, the air is still too cool and much too dry for the alveoli\u2019s liking. This can lead to problems with the conditioning backup system, such as dehydration and changes in osmolarity, pH, and temperature of the protective fluid, which can ultimately lead to bronchoconstriction (asthma).", "The backup conditioning system in the human body that adds moisture to the inhaled air is the upper parts of the lungs. This system works by naturally adding moisture to the inhaled air if necessary, through the surface liquid of the respiratory epithelium (the membrane that lines the bronchial tubes). When dry inhaled-through-the-mouth air passes the bronchial tubes, this surface liquid is drawn into the breath, thus leaving the respiratory epithelium dehydrated and changing the osmolarity, pH, and temperature of the protective fluid.", "Exercise-induced asthma is a condition where the airways become narrowed or constricted during physical activity, making it difficult to breathe. It is a type of asthma that is triggered by exercise, and it affects about 12-15% of the population. The exact cause of exercise-induced asthma is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to changes in the body's hormones and chemicals during exercise.\n\nDuring an exercise-induced asthma episode, the muscles around the airways constrict, the lining of the airways swells, and excess mucus is excreted. These changes combine to constrict airflow to the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. Symptoms of exercise-induced asthma can include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness.\n\nIt is important to note that exercise-induced asthma is different from other types of asthma, such as allergic asthma, which is triggered by exposure to allergens like pollen or dust mites. Exercise-induced asthma can be managed with medication and other treatments, and", "Synovial joints are joints that allow the greatest mobility and flexibility of all joints in the human body. They are named for the fluid, synovia, which cushions the articulating bones and allows for their characteristic flexibility. Synovial fluid contains special proteins which provide its slippery, lubricating nature. The movement and flexibility of synovial joints are allowed by their structure, which includes articular cartilage, the articular capsule, the synovial membrane, and synovial fluid. These structures work together to cushion the bones, provide stability, and allow for smooth movement. Synovial joints are important for human movement because they allow for a wide range of motion, enabling activities such as walking, running, and reaching.", "Articular cartilage and ligaments play important roles in synovial joints. Articular cartilage is a spongy covering that protects the ends of the bones where they come together in a synovial joint. It absorbs compression between the bones and prevents damage to the bone ends. Ligaments, on the other hand, reinforce the joint and provide support and stability. They run within the articular capsule matrix, outside the capsule, and even within the joint cavity itself. Joints are also stabilized by muscle tendons that are external to their capsules and are also innervated to monitor position and stretch.", "The structure of synovial joints allows for their characteristic flexibility and mobility through several factors. Firstly, the ends of the bones that come together in synovial joints are protected by articular cartilage, which absorbs compression between the bones and prevents damage to the bone ends. This allows for smooth and pain-free movement of the joint. Secondly, the joint is surrounded by the articular capsule, which encloses the synovial cavity and provides stability to the joint. The capsule is made of fibrous connective tissue on the outside and the synovial membrane on the inside, which is in contact with the synovial fluid and covers any bone surfaces not covered by articular cartilage. The synovial fluid seeps into the articular cartilage to lubricate and nourish its cells, providing the necessary slippery and lubricating nature for the joint to move freely. Lastly, the joint is reinforced by ligaments, which provide support and stability, and are innervated to monitor both pain and degree of capsule stretch."]
