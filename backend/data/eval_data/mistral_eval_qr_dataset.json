Over time, the basic holds and techniques of wrestling have remained relatively consistent, but the specific rules and styles have varied from culture to culture.\n\nIn the United States, wrestling has evolved to include a variety of styles and types, including collegiate, freestyle, Greco-Roman, professional, and no-holds barred or submission wrestling. Judo, jujitsu, and mixed martial arts also have a large wrestling component and are practiced in the U.S.\n\nJudo, freestyle, and Greco-Roman wrestling are all Olympic sports, and mixed martial arts and submission wrestling have had a significant impact on current martial art practices. The history of wrestling as a martial art has been shaped by cultural and historical factors, and it continues to evolve and adapt to new techniques and styles.",

These styles differ from each other in terms of rules and techniques used. Freestyle wrestling allows the use of throws, holds, and pins, while Greco-Roman wrestling prohibits the use of throws and only allows holds and pins above the waist. Judo, on the other hand, focuses on throws and submission holds, while Sambo incorporates elements of both freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, as well as striking techniques.",

        "aaa162a8-694d-4bd2-8a0c-f983017d0117": "The main finding of the research on aggression and gender in competitive sports is that while females may choose not to act aggressively in neutral situations, they interpret aggression as an appropriate and justifiable response to provocation. The sporting arena can be perceived as a circumstance in which women could legitimately exhibit traits such as dominance, competitiveness, and aggression without being confronted with masculine stereotypes. However, the legitimization of female aggression in sports does not apply or justify aggression in other non-sporting social contexts. The research also suggests that female athletes are equally as aggressive as male athletes in competitive sports such as Taekwondo because they see the situation as permitting females to behave aggressively and have been socialized to do so.",
        "526925ce-add0-426d-8f9a-051a9d498350": "The sporting context contributes to the amplification and legitimization of aggression in female athletes by providing a space for the expression of otherwise discouraged traits. In competitive sports such as Taekwondo, where aggression is prevalent and reinforced in both males and females, the propensity for female athletes to display aggression is amplified. The legitimization of female aggression is further magnified by the encouragement of coaches, female role models, and family members, which maximizes athletic potential. Socialization of female athletes to subdue aggressive tendencies may be reversed when they become highly involved in sports. The sporting context provides a relief from the confining social constraints placed on women's behavior by encouraging and providing a space for the amplification and legitimization of otherwise discouraged traits.",

However, aggression in other social contexts is not comparable to aggression in sports, as it is not legally or socially acceptable. The socialization of female athletes to subdue aggressive tendencies may be reversed when they become highly involved in sports, and the sporting context provides a relief from the confining social constraints placed on women's behavior by encouraging and providing a space for the amplification and legitimization of otherwise discouraged traits.",

Grandmaster Ji began training yoo sool (Korean for jujitsu) with Grandmaster Choi at the age of 13 in Daegu city. During this time, Grandmaster Ji also trained under a master known as \"Taoist Lee,\" from whom he learned tae-kyon kicking, jang-bong (six-foot staff), pe dan-bong (short stick), and meditation. Grandmaster Ji also studied meditation for five years under a female monk known to him as \"Grandma.\"\n\nAfter leaving Daegu city in 1958, Grandmaster Ji opened two yoo sool schools in Andong and later relocated to Seoul. His teachings and techniques had a significant impact on the development of modern hapkido, and he is considered by some to be one of the founders of modern hapkido alongside Grandmaster Choi. Grandmaster Ji's training with Grandmaster Choi likely influenced the incorporation of kicking and weapons techniques into yoo sool, which later became known as hapkido.",

According to the literature, social legitimacy refers to the acceptance and recognition of a particular activity or behavior by society. When women are able to feel confident and welcomed as active participants in Taekwondo, they are more likely to perceive the sport as socially legitimate and feel a sense of self-efficacy. This can be achieved by actively encouraging or passively demonstrating the legitimacy of the endeavor, as well as providing clear evaluation guidelines that reduce gender differences in self-confidence.",

According to Cox, if feedback is clear and specific, it can help individuals develop a sense of self-efficacy and confidence in their abilities. However, if feedback is ambiguous or unclear, it can lead to lower self-confidence levels, particularly among women. This is because women tend to be more sensitive to social cues and may interpret ambiguous feedback as a sign of disapproval or lack of support. In contrast, men may be more resilient to ambiguous feedback and may still maintain high levels of self-confidence. Therefore, it is important to provide clear and specific feedback to help individuals build their self-confidence and achieve their goals.",

        "de18da21-52ce-45a6-ad68-dc8789274cdb": "The relationship between air temperature and humidity affects the conditioning process of the alveoli in the lungs. When the air temperature is cooler, it is less able to hold moisture, which can lead to dry air being inhaled by the lungs. This can be problematic for the alveoli, as they prefer warm, moist air. However, the human body has a backup conditioning system in the upper parts of the lungs that can add moisture to the inhaled air if necessary. This helps to protect the alveoli from damage.\n\nDuring exercise, the ventilation rate increases and can exceed 200 L per minute. This increased air intake can lead to cool, dry air being inhaled through the mouth, bypassing the upper airway conditioning. This can cause the respiratory epithelium to become dehydrated and change the osmolarity, pH, and temperature of the protective fluid. This can lead to exercise-induced asthma in some individuals.",

They are named for the fluid, synovia, which cushions the articulating bones and allows for their characteristic flexibility. Synovial fluid contains special proteins which provide its slippery, lubricating nature. The movement and flexibility of synovial joints are allowed by their structure. The ends of the bones are protected by articular cartilage, spongy coverings which absorb compression between the bones and prevent damage to the bone ends. Surrounding the joint is the articular capsule, which links together the two bones and encloses the synovial cavity, the space in which synovial fluid separates the articulating bones. Externally, this capsule is made of fibrous connective tissue, which binds the joint. Internally, the synovial membrane consists of looser connective tissue, which is in contact with the synovial fluid and covers any bone surfaces not covered by articular cartilage.
