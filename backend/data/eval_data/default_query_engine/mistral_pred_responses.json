["Wrestling is a martial art that has a long and rich history dating back over 5000 years. The basic holds and techniques of wrestling have changed very little over time, but the specific rules have varied from culture to culture. The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) recognizes four main styles of amateur wrestling that are practiced internationally today: freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, Judo, and Sambo.\n\nIn the United States, wrestling has evolved to include collegiate, freestyle, Greco-Roman, professional, and no-holds barred or submission wrestling. Additionally, martial arts such as judo, jujutsu, and mixed martial arts have a large wrestling component and are practiced in the U.S.\n\nThe history of wrestling in the U.S. can be traced back to the Greco-Roman style, which was popular during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, a new style of wrestling emerged on the American frontier, known as \"Catch-As-Catch-Can\" (freestyle) wrestling. This style became very popular in the U", "The four main styles of amateur wrestling that are practiced internationally today are freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, Judo, and Sambo. These styles differ from each other in terms of rules and techniques. Freestyle wrestling allows the use of throws, holds, and pins, while Greco-Roman wrestling prohibits the use of throws and only allows holds and pins. Judo, on the other hand, focuses on throws and submission holds, while Sambo is a relatively new martial art that was developed in Russia and has not had a major influence on wrestling in the United States.", "Some of the martial arts that have a large wrestling component and are practiced in the United States include judo, jujitsu, and mixed martial arts.", "The main finding of the research on aggression and gender in competitive sports is that the levels of aggression between male and female athletes are comparable, but differed with regards to the mechanisms that provoke and legitimize it. The studies also suggested that these responses are dependent upon the circumstances of provocation. There are no differences in the display of aggression between males and females in situations where aggressive behavior is deemed appropriate, suggesting that the differences between the sexes are due to the situation and not to innate qualities. On the other hand, there is a decreased tendency for women to display aggression in unprovoked circumstances where aggressive behavior is considered less acceptable.", "The sporting context contributes to the amplification and legitimization of aggression in female athletes by providing a space for the amplification and legitimization of otherwise discouraged traits. The sporting context encourages athletes to focus on forceful kicks and strikes to an opponent's scoring zones, and the emphasis placed on points being rewarded when a technique is powerfully and accurately delivered can be considered a legitimate cause for exhibiting aggressive behavior. Additionally, the sporting context provides a relief from the confining social constraints placed on women's behavior by encouraging and providing a space for the amplification and legitimization of otherwise discouraged traits. This can lead to the socialization of female athletes to subdue aggressive tendencies being reversed, resulting in the amplification of their propensity to display aggression.", "According to Susan Birrell, aggression in sports is legal and normative behavior, meaning it is an acceptable and expected feature of that particular social situation. However, aggression in other social contexts is not necessarily legal or normative, and therefore may not be considered appropriate or justifiable. Additionally, aggression in sports is often encouraged and legitimized by coaches, female role models, and family members, which can amplify the propensity for female athletes to display aggression. In contrast, aggression in other social contexts may not have the same level of encouragement or legitimization, which can limit the propensity for aggression.", "The file path of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" is \"/app/data/processed_data/@M7 Papers/0 PDF Files/Copenhaver, Laura - Yongmudo Cross-Training.pdf\".", "I'm sorry, but I cannot determine the file size of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" based on the provided context information.

Grandmaster Ji began training yoo sool with Grandmaster Choi at the age of 13 in Daegu city, where they both were instrumental in publicizing hapkido throughout Korea following the Korean War. Grandmaster Ji also trained under a master known as \"Taoist Lee,\" from whom he learned tae-kyon kicking, jang-bong (six-foot staff), pe dan-bong (short stick), and meditation. Additionally, Grandmaster Ji studied meditation for five years under a female monk known to him as \"Grandma.\"\n\nLater, Grandmaster Ji left Daegu city and moved to Andong where he opened two yoo sool schools. He remained in Andong for only a short period of time before relocating to Seoul later in 1958. During this time, Grandmaster Ji's martial arts curriculum was finalized through a unique period of collaboration with a fellow colleague and former student Kim Moo Woong. Over the course of nearly eight months, Kim and Grandmaster Ji trained together and exchanged ideas about which", "The context information does not provide any information about when or where Grandmaster Ji left Daegu city.", "The role of social legitimacy in increasing a female athlete's sense of self-efficacy in Taekwondo is to redefine the social legitimacy of the sport and construct an environment in which women feel confident and welcomed as active participants. This can be achieved by encouraging and demonstrating the legitimacy of the endeavor, providing clear and positive feedback, and reducing ambiguity in the evaluation of performance. By doing so, female athletes can feel more confident in their abilities and more comfortable pursuing the sport.", "The quality and quantity of feedback can significantly affect a person's self-confidence. According to Cox, clear feedback regarding a person's performance can increase their self-confidence, while unclear and ambiguous feedback can lead to lower self-confidence. This is particularly true for women, who tend to have lower opinions of their abilities and respond with lower levels of self-confidence when feedback is unclear and ambiguous. Therefore, it is important to provide clear and constructive feedback to help individuals build their self-confidence.", "There are several gender-specific and situational variables that adversely affect women's self-confidence in athletic scholarship. These include tasks perceived as masculine, ambiguous feedback or ability information, and social comparison evaluation. When tasks are traditionally seen as masculine, gender differences in confidence are more likely to occur. When feedback is unclear and ambiguous, women tend to have lower opinions of their abilities and respond with lower levels of self-confidence than men. Additionally, social comparison evaluation can also negatively impact women's self-confidence, particularly in activities such as Taekwondo sparring where society's association of martial arts with masculinity can affect their self-perception of their ability to excel.", "The file name of the document provided in the context information is not explicitly stated.

When the air temperature is cooler, it is less able to hold moisture, which can lead to dryness in the lungs. On the other hand, when the air temperature is warmer, it is able to hold more moisture, which can help to keep the alveoli safe from damage. In the range of air temperature and humidity that is comfortable to exercise, the air is still too cool and much too dry for the alveoli\u2019s liking. This can lead to problems with the conditioning backup system, such as dehydration and changes in osmolarity, pH, and temperature of the protective fluid, which can ultimately lead to bronchoconstriction (asthma).", "The backup conditioning system in the human body that adds moisture to the inhaled air is the upper parts of the lungs. This system works by naturally adding moisture to the inhaled air if necessary, through the surface liquid of the respiratory epithelium (the membrane that lines the bronchial tubes). When dry inhaled-through-the-mouth air passes the bronchial tubes, this surface liquid is drawn into the breath, thus leaving the respiratory epithelium dehydrated and changing the osmolarity, pH, and temperature of the protective fluid.", "Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a condition where the airways become narrowed or constricted during physical activity, making it difficult to breathe. It is a type of asthma that is triggered by exercise, and it affects about 12-15% of the population. The exact cause of EIA is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the release of certain chemicals in the body during exercise, such as histamine and leukotrienes. These chemicals can cause the airways to narrow, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing.\n\nEIA can occur in people with chronic asthma or in those with allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis. It is important to note that EIA is reversible, meaning that the symptoms can be controlled with medication or other treatments.\n\nThere are several ways to manage EIA, including using inhaled medications such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids, avoiding triggers such as cold air or certain types of exercise, and using techniques such as pursed-lip breathing to help expand the airways during exercise. It is also important for", "Synovial joints are joints that allow the greatest mobility and flexibility of all joints in the human body. They are named for the fluid, synovia, which cushions the articulating bones and allows for their characteristic flexibility. Synovial fluid contains special proteins which provide its slippery, lubricating nature. The movement and flexibility of synovial joints are allowed by their structure, which includes articular cartilage, the articular capsule, the synovial membrane, and synovial fluid. These structures work together to cushion the bones, provide stability, and allow for the characteristic flexibility of synovial joints. Synovial joints are important for human movement because they allow for the greatest range of motion and flexibility in the body, enabling activities such as running, jumping, and reaching.", "Articular cartilage and ligaments play important roles in synovial joints. Articular cartilage is a spongy covering that protects the ends of the bones where they come together in a synovial joint. It absorbs compression between the bones and prevents damage to the bone ends. Ligaments, on the other hand, reinforce the joint and provide support and stability. They run within the articular capsule matrix, outside the capsule, and even within the joint cavity itself. Joints are also stabilized by muscle tendons, which are also innervated to monitor position and stretch.", "The structure of synovial joints allows for their characteristic flexibility and mobility through the presence of articular cartilage, the articular capsule, the synovial membrane, and the synovial fluid. Articular cartilage provides cushioning between the bones and prevents damage to the bone ends, allowing for movement. The articular capsule links together the two bones and encloses the synovial cavity, providing support and stability. The synovial membrane is in contact with the synovial fluid and covers any bone surfaces not covered by articular cartilage, allowing for lubrication and nourishment of the cartilage cells. Synovial fluid seeps into the articular cartilage to lubricate and nourish its cells. Ligaments reinforce the joint, providing support and stability. Muscle tendons also stabilize the joint, monitoring position and stretch. The presence of these structures allows for the characteristic flexibility and mobility of synovial joints."]
