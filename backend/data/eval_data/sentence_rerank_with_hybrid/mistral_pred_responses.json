["Wrestling is one of the oldest martial arts or sports, with its basic holds and techniques changing very little over time. The specific rules of wrestling have varied from culture to culture and over time. The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) recognizes four main styles of amateur wrestling that are practiced internationally today: freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, Judo, and Sambo.\n\nIn the United States, common styles of wrestling include collegiate, freestyle, Greco-Roman, professional, and no-holds barred or submission wrestling. Judo, freestyle, and Greco-Roman wrestling are all Olympic sports. Judo is included in this discussion since it has a large wrestling component in its style.\n\nThe history of wrestling can be traced back to ancient Greece, where it was part of Greek ritual and valued by the Greeks. Pankration, a \"no holds barred\" style of wrestling, was popular in Greece until approximately 900 B.C. when Theseus, the legendary king of Athens, decided to formulate more stringent rules.\n\nWrestling was also", "The four main styles of amateur wrestling that are practiced internationally today are freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, Judo, and Sambo. These styles differ from each other in terms of rules and techniques. Freestyle wrestling allows the use of throws and holds from any position, while Greco-Roman wrestling only allows holds above the waist and no throws. Judo focuses on throws and submission holds, while Sambo is a relatively new martial art that combines elements of Russian wrestling with judo techniques.", "Some of the martial arts that have a large wrestling component and are practiced in the United States include judo, jujutsu, and mixed martial arts.", "The main finding of the research on aggression and gender in competitive sports is that aggression plays a significant role in athletic performance and that the levels of aggression between male and female athletes are comparable, but differed with regards to the mechanisms that provoke and legitimize it. The research also suggests that the differences between the sexes are due to the situation and not to innate qualities, and that there is a decreased tendency for women to display aggression in unprovoked circumstances where aggressive behavior is considered less acceptable. Additionally, the research highlights the role of social learning theory in the development and augmentation of aggressive behavior, and the impact of social experiences and immediate situations on observed gender influences on aggressive behavior in sports.", "The sporting context contributes to the amplification and legitimization of aggression in female athletes by providing a space for the amplification and legitimization of otherwise discouraged traits. In competitive sports such as Taekwondo, where aggression is prevalent and reinforced in both males and females, the propensity for female athletes to display aggression is amplified. The legitimization of female aggression is further magnified by the encouragement of coaches, female role models, and family members, which maximizes athletic potential. The sporting context provides a relief from the confining social constraints placed on women's behavior by encouraging and providing a space for the amplification and legitimization of otherwise discouraged traits. This may account for the suggestion that female athletes are equally as aggressive as male athletes because \"they see the situation as permitting females to behave aggressively\" and that they have been socialized to subdue aggressive tendencies.", "According to Susan Birrell, aggression in sports is different from aggression in other social contexts because it is legal and normative behavior in the sporting arena. It is an acceptable and expected feature of that particular social situation. However, aggression in other social contexts is not comparable to aggression in sports, as it is not legal or normative behavior in those contexts.", "The file path of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" is \"/app/data/processed_data/@M7 Papers/0 PDF Files/Copenhaver, Laura - Yongmudo Cross-Training.pdf\".", "The file size of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" is not provided in the context information.", "The creation date of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" is April 2, 2005.", "The file name of the document located at /app/data/processed_data/@M7 Papers/0 PDF Files/Brown, Steve - Matwork Drills.pdf is \"Brown, Steve - Matwork Drills.pdf\".", "The file type of the document located at /app/data/processed_data/@M7 Papers/0 PDF Files/Brown, Steve - Matwork Drills.pdf is PDF.", "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an answer to that query as it is not related to the provided context information.", "The name of the author of the paper \"Sandy Liu's Training in Hapkido and Asthma Control\" is not provided in the given context information.", "The title of the paper \"Hien Nguyen's Study of Hankido and Integrative Biology\" is not provided in the given context information.", "Joshua Schwartz is a graduate student at the University of Wyoming in Geology and Geophysics.

Grandmaster Choi was one of the first to devise the name hapkido, and Grandmaster Ji's training with him helped to refine and finalize the name. Additionally, Grandmaster Ji's training with Grandmaster Choi influenced the development of hapkido's curriculum, particularly in terms of kicking techniques. Grandmaster Ji also taught Grandmaster Choi the low turning heel kick technique, which was different from the technique taught by Grandmaster Choi's colleague and former student, Kim Moo Woong. Overall, Grandmaster Ji's training with Grandmaster Choi helped to shape the modern hapkido that is practiced today.", "Grandmaster Ji left Daegu city in 1958 and moved to Andong.", "The role of social legitimacy in increasing a female athlete's sense of self-efficacy in Taekwondo is significant. The sport provides an opportunity for women to legitimize stereotypic male behaviors such as aggression and direct it in a manner conducive to enhancing athletic performance. This is due to the combative nature of Taekwondo, which allows athletes to freely express their aggressive tendencies.\n\nSocial legitimacy refers to the acceptance and approval of a particular behavior or activity by a particular subset of society, including immediate friends, coaches, and family members. This subset of society plays a crucial role in an athlete's assessment of self-worth and can significantly influence their sense of self-efficacy.\n\nIn Taekwondo, social legitimacy is achieved by redefining traditional limitations placed on women and constructing a sport in which women can feel confident and welcomed as active participants. This allows female athletes to excel to their full potential and increases their sense of self-efficacy.\n\nIn conclusion, social legitimacy plays a crucial role in increasing a female athlete's sense of self-efficacy in Taekwondo by", "The quality and quantity of feedback can significantly affect a person's self-confidence. According to Cox, clear feedback regarding a person's performance can increase their self-confidence, while unclear and ambiguous feedback can lead to lower self-confidence. This is particularly true for women, who tend to have lower opinions of their abilities and respond with lower levels of self-confidence when feedback is unclear. Therefore, it is important to provide clear and constructive feedback to help individuals build their self-confidence.", "There are several gender-specific and situational variables that adversely affect women's self-confidence in athletic scholarship. These include:\n\n1. Tasks perceived as masculine: When tasks are traditionally seen as masculine, women may experience gender differences in confidence.\n2. Ambiguous feedback or ability information: If feedback is unclear and ambiguous, women tend to have lower opinions of their abilities and lower levels of self-confidence than men.\n3. Social comparison evaluation: When evaluation emphasizes social comparison, women may experience gender differences in confidence.\n\nIn the context of Taekwondo, society's association of martial arts with masculinity can negatively affect women's self-perception of their ability to excel. Combined with a lack of clear feedback or encouragement, society's negative impression of women's participation in Taekwondo can seriously compromise their self-confidence.", "The file name of the document provided in the context information is \"Shearer, Alex.pdf\".", "The file size of the document provided in the context information is not specified.", "The creation date of the document provided in the context information is not specified.", "The relationship between air temperature and humidity affects the conditioning process of the alveoli in the lungs. The warmer the air, the more moisture it is able to keep in vapor form, while the cooler the air, the less moisture it is able to hold. This can cause damage to the alveoli when the air is too cool and dry, especially during exercise. The conditioning process is important for the protection of the delicate alveoli, and the human body has a backup conditioning system in the upper parts of the lungs that can add moisture to the inhaled air if necessary. However, when the inhaled air bypasses the upper airway conditioning due to exercise or other factors, it can lead to dryness and dehydration of the respiratory epithelium, which can cause asthma or exacerbate existing asthma.", "The backup conditioning system in the human body that adds moisture to the inhaled air is the upper parts of the lungs. This system works by naturally adding moisture to the inhaled air if necessary, through the process of conditioning. The surface of this part of the lungs, along with most surfaces within the human body, is naturally moist. When dry inhaled-through-the-mouth air passes the bronchial tubes, the surface liquid is drawn into the breath, thus leaving the respiratory epithelium (the membrane that lines the bronchial tubes) dehydrated and changing the osmolarity, pH, and temperature of the protective fluid.", "Exercise-induced asthma is a condition where difficulty in breathing occurs as a result of physical exertion. It is a reversible obstructive airway disorder that affects about 12-15% of the general population. The exact cause of exercise-induced asthma is not fully understood, but two theories have been proposed: the water loss theory and the heat-exchange theory. The water loss theory suggests that the conditioning of air inhaled through the nose adds moisture and warms up the air, which is important for the protection of the delicate airways. The heat-exchange theory proposes that the body's response to heat during exercise causes the airways to constrict, leading to difficulty in breathing.", "Synovial joints are a type of joint that allows the greatest mobility and flexibility exhibited by our bodies. They are named for the fluid, synovia, which cushions the articulating bones and allows for their characteristic flexibility. Synovial fluid contains special proteins which provide its slippery, lubricating nature. Synovial joints are important for human movement because they allow for the movement and flexibility of bones in our body. They are also the most vulnerable links in the skeleton, making them a target for martial arts techniques.", "Articular cartilage and ligaments play important roles in synovial joints. Articular cartilage is a spongy covering that cushions the ends of bones in synovial joints, absorbing compression between the bones and preventing damage to the bone ends. Ligaments, on the other hand, reinforce the joint by running within the articular capsule matrix, outside the capsule, and even within the joint cavity itself. They provide support and stability to the joint. Additionally, ligaments monitor the position and stretch of the joint, and are innervated to respond to pain.", "The structure of synovial joints allows for their characteristic flexibility and mobility through several factors. First, the ends of the bones that come together in synovial joints are protected by articular cartilage, which absorbs compression between the bones and prevents damage. This allows for smooth movement between the bones without friction or pain.\n\nSecond, surrounding the joint is the articular capsule, which links the two bones and encloses the synovial cavity. The capsule is made of fibrous connective tissue on the outside and looser connective tissue on the inside, which allows for some degree of flexibility and mobility.\n\nThird, the synovial membrane, which is in contact with the synovial fluid and covers any bone surfaces not covered by articular cartilage, also plays a role in the joint's flexibility. The membrane allows for some degree of movement between the bones and helps to lubricate the joint.\n\nFinally, the synovial fluid itself is a key component of the joint's flexibility. It contains special proteins that provide its slippery, lubricating nature, allowing for smooth movement between the bones.\n\nOverall, the structure of"]
