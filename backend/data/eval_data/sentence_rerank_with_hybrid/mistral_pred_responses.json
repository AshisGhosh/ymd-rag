["Wrestling is one of the oldest martial arts or sports, with its basic holds and techniques changing very little over time. The specific rules of wrestling have varied from culture to culture and over time. The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) recognizes four main styles of amateur wrestling that are practiced internationally today: freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, Judo, and Sambo.\n\nIn the United States, common styles of wrestling include collegiate, freestyle, Greco-Roman, professional, and no-holds barred or submission wrestling. Judo, freestyle, and Greco-Roman wrestling are all Olympic sports. Judo is included in this discussion since it has a large wrestling component in its style.\n\nThe history of wrestling can be traced back to ancient Greece, where it was part of Greek ritual and important to their culture. Wrestling was especially held in esteem by the Greeks, who developed a style called pankration, a \"no holds barred\" style that was particularly rough and gory. The rules of wrestling in the ancient Olympics are fragmented, incomplete, and open to interpretation", "The four main styles of amateur wrestling that are practiced internationally today are freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, Judo, and Sambo. Freestyle wrestling allows the use of throws and holds from any position, while Greco-Roman wrestling only allows throws from a standing position. Judo focuses on throws and ground fighting techniques, while Sambo is a relatively new martial arts style that was developed in Russia and has not had a major influence on wrestling in the United States.", "Some of the martial arts that have a large wrestling component and are practiced in the United States include judo, jujutsu, and mixed martial arts.", "The main finding of the research on aggression and gender in competitive sports is that aggression plays a significant role in athletic performance and that the levels of aggression between male and female athletes are comparable, but differed with regards to the mechanisms that provoke and legitimize it. The research also suggests that there are no differences in the display of aggression between males and females in situations where aggressive behavior is deemed appropriate, but there is a decreased tendency for women to display aggression in unprovoked circumstances where aggressive behavior is considered less acceptable. Additionally, the role of aggression is further magnified in Taekwondo sparring due to its combative nature and the link of aggression with athletic performance is even more relevant in Taekwondo sparring where athletes are driven to deliver kicks and punches with a considerable degree of force to their opponent.", "The sporting context contributes to the amplification and legitimization of aggression in female athletes by providing a space for the expression of traits that are demanded by high-level competitive sport participation, such as dominance, competitiveness, and aggression. The sporting context also encourages the display of aggressive behavior by providing a relief from the confining social constraints placed on women's behavior. Additionally, the sporting context can provide a sense of social legitimacy for aggressive behavior, as it is considered an acceptable and expected feature of that particular social situation. This can lead to an increase in the propensity for female athletes to display aggression, as well as an increase in the frequency and intensity of aggressive behavior.", "According to Susan Birrell, aggression in sports is different from aggression in other social contexts because it is legal and normative behavior in the sporting arena. This means that it is an acceptable and expected feature of that particular social situation. In contrast, aggression in other social contexts may not be legal or normative, and may be viewed as inappropriate or unjustifiable. Additionally, Birrell notes that aggression in sports is often reinforced and encouraged, while in other social contexts it may be discouraged or stigmatized.", "The file path of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" is \"/app/data/processed_data/@M6 Papers/0 PDF Files/Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\".", "I'm sorry, but I cannot determine the file size of the document \"Copenhaver, Laura.pdf\" based on the provided context information.

Grandmaster Choi was one of the first individuals to develop and teach the art of hapkido, and Grandmaster Ji's training with him helped to refine and expand upon the techniques and principles of hapkido.\n\nGrandmaster Ji's training with Grandmaster Choi helped to establish the foundations of modern hapkido, including the use of joint locks, throws, and kicks. Grandmaster Ji also incorporated elements of meditation and spiritual training into his teachings, which helped to give hapkido a unique and holistic approach to martial arts.\n\nGrandmaster Ji's teachings and training methods were influential in the development of modern hapkido, and his contributions helped to establish the art as a respected and effective form of self-defense and martial arts.", "Grandmaster Ji left Daegu city in 1958 and moved to Andong.", "The role of social legitimacy in increasing a female athlete's sense of self-efficacy in Taekwondo is significant. According to the provided context information, social legitimacy refers to the acceptance and approval of a particular behavior or activity by a subset of society, including immediate friends, coaches, and family members. In the context of Taekwondo, social legitimacy can be seen as the acceptance and approval of the sport by this subset of society, which can positively impact a female athlete's sense of self-efficacy.\n\nThe provided context information suggests that social legitimacy can be achieved by redefining social legitimacy and constructing a sport in which women can feel confident and welcomed as active participants. This can be achieved by providing clear feedback regarding performance, which can positively impact a female athlete's sense of self-confidence.\n\nIn summary, social legitimacy plays a crucial role in increasing a female athlete's sense of self-efficacy in Taekwondo by providing a supportive and accepting environment for women to participate in the sport and by providing clear feedback regarding performance.", "The quality and quantity of feedback can significantly affect a person's self-confidence. According to Cox, clear feedback regarding a person's performance can increase their self-confidence, while unclear and ambiguous feedback can lead to lower self-confidence. This is particularly true for women, who tend to have lower opinions of their abilities and respond with lower levels of self-confidence when feedback is unclear. Therefore, it is important to provide clear and constructive feedback to help individuals build their self-confidence.", "There are several gender-specific and situational variables that can adversely affect women's self-confidence in athletic scholarship. These include:\n\n1. Tasks perceived as masculine: When tasks are traditionally seen as masculine, women may experience gender differences in confidence.\n2. Ambiguous feedback or ability information: If feedback is unclear and ambiguous, women tend to have lower opinions of their abilities and lower levels of self-confidence than men.\n3. Social comparison evaluation: When evaluation emphasizes social comparison, women may experience gender differences in confidence.\n\nIn the context of Taekwondo, the combative nature of the sport and society's association of martial arts with masculinity can negatively affect women's self-perception of their ability to excel. Combined with a lack of clear feedback or encouragement, this can seriously compromise their self-confidence.", "The file name of the document provided in the context information is \"Shearer, Alex.pdf\".", "The file size of the document provided in the context information is not specified.", "The creation date of the document provided in the context information is not explicitly stated.

The warmer the air, the more moisture it is able to keep in vapor form, while the cooler the air, the less moisture it is able to hold. This means that on cool crisp days, the alveoli's liking for warm moist air is not met, and they are exposed to cool dry air. In the range of air temperature and humidity that is comfortable to exercise, the air is still too cool and much too dry for the alveoli's liking. This can lead to damage to the alveoli if the air is not properly conditioned before being inhaled.", "The backup conditioning system in the human body that adds moisture to the inhaled air is the upper parts of the lungs. This system works by naturally adding moisture to the inhaled air if necessary, through the surface of the respiratory epithelium (the membrane that lines the bronchial tubes). When the inhaled air passes through the bronchial tubes, the surface liquid is drawn into the breath, thus leaving the respiratory epithelium dehydrated and changing the osmolarity, pH, and temperature of the protective fluid. This process helps to keep the delicate alveoli safe from damage.", "Exercise-induced asthma is a condition where difficulty in breathing occurs as a result of physical exertion. It is a reversible obstructive airway disorder that affects about 12-15% of the general population, including people who have no other symptoms related to asthma or allergies. The exact cause of exercise-induced asthma is not fully understood, but two theories have been proposed: the water loss theory and the heat-exchange theory. The water loss theory suggests that the conditioning of air inhaled through the nose adds moisture and warms up the air, which is important for the protection of the delicate airways. The heat-exchange theory proposes that the body's response to exercise involves a rapid exchange of heat between the body and the environment, which can cause the airways to constrict and narrow.", "Synovial joints are a type of joint that allows the greatest mobility and flexibility exhibited by our bodies. They are named for the fluid, synovia, which cushions the articulating bones and allows for their characteristic flexibility. Synovial fluid contains special proteins which provide its slippery, lubricating nature. Synovial joints are important for human movement because they allow for the movement and flexibility of bones in our body. They are found in various parts of the body, including the wrist, elbow, and shoulder. The structure of synovial joints, including the articular cartilage, articular capsule, synovial membrane, and synovial fluid, allows for their characteristic flexibility and mobility.", "Articular cartilage and ligaments play important roles in synovial joints. Articular cartilage is a spongy covering that cushions the ends of bones in synovial joints, absorbing compression between the bones and preventing damage to the bone ends. Ligaments, on the other hand, reinforce the joint by running within the articular capsule matrix, outside the capsule, and even within the joint cavity itself. They provide support and stability to the joint. Additionally, ligaments monitor the position and stretch of the joint, and are innervated to respond to pain.", "The structure of synovial joints allows for their characteristic flexibility and mobility due to several factors. First, the ends of the bones that come together in synovial joints are protected by articular cartilage, which absorbs compression between the bones and prevents damage to the bone ends. This allows for smooth and pain-free movement of the joint.\n\nSecond, surrounding the joint is the articular capsule, which links together the two bones and encloses the synovial cavity, the space in which synovial fluid separates the articulating bones. The capsule is made of fibrous connective tissue, which provides stability to the joint, while internally, the synovial membrane consists of looser connective tissue, which is in contact with the synovial fluid and covers any bone surfaces not covered by articular cartilage. This allows for the lubrication and nourishment of the joint.\n\nThird, synovial fluid contains special proteins which provide its slippery, lubricating nature. This fluid seeps into the articular cartilage to lubricate and nourish its cells, allowing for smooth and pain-free movement of the joint.\n\n"]
